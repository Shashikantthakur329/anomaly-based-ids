# JIIS23-dataset
This private repository contains the dataset of the publications "Learning autoencoder ensembles for detecting malware hidden communications in IoT ecosystems". In particular:

- the "clean" directory contains the statistics of the clean traffic of 4 days
- the "case1" directory contains the statistics of the traffic containing covert channels in the TTL field of 3 days consindering the Naive Encoding Scheme
- the "case2" directory contains the statistics of the traffic containing covert channels in the TTL field of 3 days Advanced Threat Scheme
